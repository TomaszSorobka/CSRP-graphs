Statement Force acting on a mass produces acceleration, changing the object's velocity over time.: (2, 0)
Statement Velocity describes speed and direction, while acceleration links changing velocity to the net force on mass.: (2, 1)
Statement Kinetic energy depends on an object's mass and velocity, increasing rapidly as velocity grows.: (1, 0)
Statement Momentum combines mass and velocity, remaining conserved in isolated systems where no external force acts.: (3, 1)
Statement Gravitational potential energy increases as an object is lifted against gravity, storing reversible mechanical energy.: (0, 1)
Statement Friction opposes motion between surfaces, converting mechanical energy into heat and reducing momentum over time.: (3, 2)
Statement In free fall, gravity accelerates a mass downward, converting gravitational potential energy into increasing kinetic energy.: (1, 1)
Statement Work transfers energy when a force moves an object, linking force, distance and kinetic energy.: (1, 2)
Statement Power measures how quickly work is done, relating transferred energy to the time interval involved.: (0, 2)
Statement Balanced forces like friction produce constant velocity, while unbalanced forces create acceleration, changing momentum and mechanical energy.: (2, 2)
