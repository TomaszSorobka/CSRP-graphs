Statement The brain uses billions of neurons to process signals, allowing the human body to coordinate movement, sensation, and thought.: (0, 0)
Statement Neurons communicate with one another through tiny electrical impulses and chemical signals, forming vast networks that link the brain to muscles and internal organs.: (1, 0)
Statement The heart pumps blood through a branching network of vessels, ensuring that red blood cells deliver oxygen and nutrients to tissues throughout the body.: (1, 3)
Statement In the lungs, inhaled air reaches microscopic alveoli where oxygen moves into the blood and carbon dioxide diffuses out to be exhaled.: (0, 3)
Statement Red blood cells are packed with hemoglobin and travel continuously between the lungs and peripheral tissues, picking up oxygen in the alveoli and releasing it where it is needed.: (0, 2)
Statement The liver filters blood coming from the digestive tract, modifies nutrients, and helps remove toxins before the blood returns to the heart.: (2, 3)
Statement Kidneys regulate the composition of the blood by adjusting water and salt levels, excreting wastes into urine while returning useful substances to circulation.: (4, 0)
Statement The small intestine provides a long folded surface where nutrients from digested food move into the blood and are carried to the liver and other organs.: (2, 4)
Statement Before nutrients reach the small intestine, other digestive organs break food into smaller molecules that can cross into the bloodstream.: (1, 4)
Statement The skin forms a protective barrier around the body, helping to prevent infection while also limiting water loss to the environment.: (3, 0)
Statement Specialized nerve endings in the skin send signals through neurons to the brain, allowing a person to sense touch, temperature, and pain.: (2, 0)
Statement The immune system depends on populations of white blood cells that patrol the blood and tissues, identifying and attacking invading microbes.: (3, 2)
Statement During an infection, white blood cells can leave the blood vessels and enter nearby tissues, where they release chemical signals that coordinate the broader immune response.: (2, 2)
Statement The skeleton provides a rigid framework that protects organs such as the brain and lungs while giving attachment points for muscles that move the limbs.: (1, 1)
Statement Muscles contract when neurons trigger them with electrical signals, and together with the skeleton they allow the body to stand upright, walk, and manipulate objects.: (2, 1)
Statement Within the bone marrow of certain skeletal bones, stem cells produce new red blood cells and white blood cells that enter the bloodstream.: (1, 2)
Statement The heart and kidneys respond to signals from the nervous system and the immune system, adjusting blood pressure, fluid balance, and blood flow to muscles and inflamed tissues when needed.: (4, 1)
Statement As the body grows and adapts, neurons, muscles, and bones change in response to activity levels, nutrition, and many other influences.: (3, 1)
