Statement An undirected graph models relationships where edges have no inherent direction, so each connection can be traversed symmetrically between vertices.: (0, 0)
Statement In a directed graph, each edge has an orientation, making concepts like in-degree, out-degree, and reachability central to the structure.: (4, 1)
Statement A weighted graph assigns a numerical weight to each edge, allowing shortest-path algorithms to minimize distance, cost, or time across a network.: (3, 1)
Statement A tree is a connected graph with no cycles, so there is exactly one simple path between any pair of vertices.: (2, 0)
Statement A directed acyclic graph, or DAG, has directed edges and no cycles, which makes it suitable for modeling dependencies such as task schedules or version histories.: (4, 0)
Statement In a complete graph, every pair of distinct vertices is joined by an edge, making it an extreme example of a dense graph.: (2, 2)
Statement A bipartite graph partitions its vertices into two disjoint sets so that every edge connects one set to the other, and no edge ever joins two vertices within the same set.: (0, 2)
Statement Planar graphs can be drawn in the plane without edge crossings, and classical results such as Kuratowski’s theorem characterize when a graph is non-planar.: (1, 3)
Statement In a sparse graph, the number of edges grows roughly on the order of the number of vertices, whereas a dense graph has edges approaching the maximum possible for its vertex count.: (1, 1)
Statement Many trees are naturally sparse graphs, since a tree on n vertices has exactly n − 1 edges, far fewer than a complete graph on the same vertex set.: (2, 1)
Statement If every vertex in an undirected graph lies in a single connected component, the structure is called a connected graph and there is some path between any two vertices.: (1, 0)
Statement In a weighted graph that is also a DAG, algorithms for longest or shortest paths can process vertices in topological order without needing to handle cycles.: (3, 0)
Statement Bipartite graphs are central in matching problems, where one seeks to pair vertices from one part with distinct neighbors in the other.: (0, 3)
Statement Some planar graphs, such as planar bipartite graphs, satisfy strong coloring and matching properties that differ from those of dense non-planar graphs.: (1, 2)
