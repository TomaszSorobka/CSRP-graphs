Statement Creole languages show that new grammatical systems can emerge quickly when speakers of Indo-European languages, Semitic languages, or Sino-Tibetan languages need a shared medium for everyday communication.: (3, 2)
Statement Romance languages grew out of spoken Latin, and they share many similar verb endings and word order patterns that distinguish them within the Indo-European languages.: (0, 3)

Statement In comparative linguistics, Indo-European languages often serve as a reference family when describing how creole languages deviate from or align with older grammatical patterns.: (3, 0)
Statement In Slavic languages, aspect is central to the verb system, contrasting with the tense-focused patterns more common in many Romance languages and Germanic languages.: (3, 4)

Statement In language typology, Indo-European languages, Semitic languages, and Sino-Tibetan languages are often compared to test how grammatical categories like tense or aspect can develop independently in different families.: (2, 2)
Statement The Indo-European languages form a large family spread across Europe and parts of Asia, including well-known Romance languages, Germanic languages, and Slavic languages.: (6, 2)
Statement Speakers of Indo-European languages may find it challenging to learn Sino-Tibetan languages or sign languages at first because tone or visual-spatial grammar feels very different from familiar patterns.: (7, 1)

Statement Sino-Tibetan languages, which include many tonal systems, are unrelated genetically to the Indo-European languages even though speakers may now live side by side in many cities.: (7, 2)
Statement Workshops for language teachers may bring together specialists in Romance languages, Slavic languages, and Sino-Tibetan languages to share strategies for explaining unfamiliar sound systems to students.: (7, 0)

Statement Many creole languages arise where speakers of different Romance languages, Germanic languages, or Semitic languages have long-term contact under trade or colonial conditions.: (5, 3)
Statement Sign languages are full languages in their own right, not visual versions of nearby Romance languages or Germanic languages, and they have their own families and histories.: (5, 1)

Statement Germanic languages, another branch of the Indo-European languages, are known for their strong and weak verb patterns and for having shifted many consonant sounds in history.: (7, 5)
Statement Semitic languages and Indo-European languages have both spread widely through religion, trade, and conquest, so their speakers now share many contact zones with Romance languages and Slavic languages.: (4, 5)
Statement Some school curricula treat sign languages, creole languages, and Indo-European languages as equally valid forms of communication, moving away from older hierarchies.: (6, 5)
