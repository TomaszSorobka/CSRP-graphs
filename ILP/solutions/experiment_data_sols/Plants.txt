Statement In most green plants, photosynthesis takes place in chloroplasts, where chlorophyll absorbs light to drive the conversion of carbon dioxide and water into sugars.: (4, 1)
Statement Chloroplasts are concentrated in mesophyll cells of leaves so that photosynthesis can capture as much light as chlorophyll can absorb in the upper layers of the plant canopy.: (3, 3)
Statement Stomata on the leaf surface open to let carbon dioxide diffuse in for photosynthesis and close to limit water loss, linking gas exchange to chloroplast activity deeper in the tissue.: (1, 0)
Statement During active photosynthesis, xylem supplies water to the leaf while phloem carries newly synthesized sugars away, tying chloroplast metabolism to long-distance transport.: (2, 1)
Statement In bright light, chlorophyll in chloroplasts can become overexcited, so plants adjust stomata and xylem water flow to keep photosynthesis efficient without overheating tissues.: (0, 3)
Statement In shade leaves, chlorophyll content is often increased so that chloroplasts can harvest more light, while photosynthesis rates per unit leaf area remain lower than in full sun.: (2, 3)
Statement When soil is dry, reduced xylem flow leads plants to close stomata, which protects the leaf from water loss but also decreases carbon dioxide supply for photosynthesis.: (0, 0)
Statement In many species, phloem loading is strongest during the day when photosynthesis is active in chloroplasts, so sugars move from leaves to roots and growing tissues along phloem pathways.: (2, 2)
Statement Under nutrient stress, chlorophyll may break down and chloroplasts lose their vivid green color, signaling that photosynthesis and phloem export of sugars are both declining.: (3, 2)
Statement In young expanding leaves, xylem and phloem bundles develop alongside emerging chloroplasts, creating a coordinated network that supports photosynthesis as soon as the leaf is exposed to light.: (3, 1)
Statement Guard cells surrounding stomata respond to light and internal signals, adjusting pore size to balance the needs of photosynthesis in chloroplasts with the risks of dehydration carried by xylem.: (0, 2)
Statement In C3 plants, photosynthesis in chloroplasts is especially sensitive to stomatal closure, because reduced carbon dioxide raises the chance of wasteful oxygen fixation by chlorophyll-based reactions.: (1, 3)
Statement In C4 plants, specialized leaf anatomy places chloroplasts in distinct cell layers so that photosynthesis can proceed efficiently even when stomata are only partially open.: (1, 2)
Statement Seasonal changes in day length and temperature alter stomatal behavior and xylem transport, shifting the balance between photosynthesis, phloem loading, and growth across the year.: (0, 1)
Statement In many trees, photosynthesis in sunlit canopy leaves supplies sugars through phloem to shaded lower branches, whose own chloroplasts and chlorophyll contribute less to the whole-plant carbon balance.: (4, 2)
Statement During recovery from drought, rehydrated xylem allows stomata to reopen and restores photosynthesis in chloroplasts, which again fuels phloem transport of sugars to repair damaged tissues.: (1, 1)
