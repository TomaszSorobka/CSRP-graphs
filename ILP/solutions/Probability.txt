Statement A sample space collects all possible outcomes, while each event and random variable induces a probability distribution.: (3, 1)
Statement A random variable assigns numerical values to outcomes, and its probability distribution determines expected value and variance.: (1, 3)
Statement Expected value summarizes the long-run average of a random variable under its probability distribution.: (1, 4)
Statement Variance measures how strongly a random variable's values spread around its expected value.: (0, 3)
Statement Two events in a sample space are independent if learning one does not alter the other's probability distribution.: (4, 2)
Statement Conditional probability describes the chance of an event given another, directly linking independence and Bayes' theorem.: (2, 0)
Statement Bayes' theorem updates a probability distribution using conditional probability, reversing which event is treated as given.: (3, 0)
Statement The law of large numbers says independent sample averages converge toward the expected value of a random variable.: (1, 2)
Statement A normal distribution is a continuous probability distribution often modeling random variables with many small independent influences.: (2, 2)
Statement A binomial distribution models the number of successes in repeated independent trials with identical probability for each event.: (3, 3)
Statement A binomial distribution with many trials resembles a normal distribution sharing similar expected value and variance.: (2, 3)
Statement Independence of events often underlies the law of large numbers and justifies using normal approximations.: (2, 1)
Statement In many models, a random variable's variance decreases when averaging independent copies, reflecting the law of large numbers.: (0, 2)
Statement Choosing an appropriate probability distribution for a random variable requires understanding independence, events, and the underlying sample space.: (3, 2)
