Statement Duncan J. Watts and Steven H. Strogatz authored the paper on the collective dynamics of 'small-world' networks.: (0, 3)
Statement The small-world phenomenon, popularly known as six degrees of separation, suggests that many large, sparse networks found in nature are likely small-world networks. [cite: 39, 57, 59]: (1, 3)
Statement Small-world network models demonstrate enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. [cite: 41]: (0, 4)
Statement Real-world examples such as the neural network of Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors exhibit small-world properties. [cite: 40, 58]: (1, 4)
Statement Many biological, technological, and social networks, which are types of dynamical systems, lie somewhere between completely regular and completely random connection topologies. [cite: 39]: (2, 4)
Statement Infectious diseases spread more easily and quickly in small-world networks compared to regular lattices due to the presence of short cuts. [cite: 42, 99, 100]: (1, 1)
Statement For small p, short cuts have a highly nonlinear effect on L, contracting distances significantly. [cite: 49]: (0, 0)
Statement The model for disease spread shows that critical infectiousness decreases rapidly, and time for global infection resembles L(p) as p increases. [cite: 97, 98]: (0, 2)
Statement The characteristic path length L(p) drops rapidly with small increases in rewiring probability p, while the clustering coefficient C(p) remains high, indicating an almost undetectable local transition to a small world. [cite: 49, 54, 95]: (3, 3)
Statement Small-world networks are an intermediate class of network topology between regular networks and random networks, characterized by high clustering like regular lattices and small characteristic path lengths like random graphs. [cite: 39, 48]: (3, 0)
Statement A random rewiring procedure, controlled by a probability parameter p, is used to tune a graph from a regular lattice to a random network, creating small-world networks in the intermediate region. [cite: 44, 45]: (4, 1)
Statement Small-world networks are generated by starting with a regular ring lattice and rewiring each edge with probability p. [cite: 44, 45]: (4, 2)
Statement The characteristic path length (L) measures the typical separation between two vertices, while the clustering coefficient (C) measures the cliquishness of a typical neighborhood. [cite: 46, 47]: (2, 0)
Statement The properties L(p) and C(p) are used to quantify the structure of these rewired graphs. [cite: 46]: (2, 1)
Statement The introduction of a few long-range edges, or short cuts, through rewiring, drastically reduces the characteristic path length L(p) without significantly affecting the clustering coefficient C(p) for small p. [cite: 49, 53]: (2, 2)
